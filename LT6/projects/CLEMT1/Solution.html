Membership in the Freedom Forum.</h2>
   <li>The attention economy that social media platforms have sparked has resulted in a number of high-profile victims, including media companies. So, one of the simplest ways to help press freedom in the Philippines is to actively follow, read, and share from independent media sites. </li>
<h2>2. Join Campaigns to press freedom.</h2>
   <li>You can show your support for Filipino journalists on social media by using the hashtag #freedom to share your thoughts.. </li>
<h2>3. Corporate and Foundation Giving..</h2>   
   <li>The investments and efforts that a company voluntarily undertakes to responsibly manage and account for its impact on society are referred to as corporate philanthropy..</li>
<h2>4. Donor Advised Fund Gifts.</h2>   
   <li>Donor-advised fund contributions should be credited to both the charitable sponsor and the donor. Because the charitable sponsor is the official contributor when you receive a donation from a donor-advised fund, you should record the gift on a donor record for that organization (e.g. Vanguard Charitable Endowment).</li>
